                            <p>Algorithm Design is all about sorting, shuffling, arithmetic... the basic building blocks of the functions and routines that make our computers so flexible. Learn how to design your own algorithms that not only perform, but do so efficiently.</p>
                            <p>A focus on lower-level program design offers something for anyone. Even if you only ever end up using pre-existing libraries in the future, an understanding of how they do what they do will definitely make your job easier.</p>

Math Models & Sims is the link between all those math courses you have to take and computers. Using various line-fitting strategies and CAS to aid in computation, you will learn the basics behind things like population models and sales projections. The midterm project involved producing an impressive purchasing model for a business.</p>
                            <p>This is one of those classes that continues to tickle at the back of your mind long after you've taken it, at unexpected times in everyday life. Good stuff.</p>

                            <p>Been using Windows your whole life? Tired of all the extra "features" that are forced upon you in mainstream operating systems today? There's another option, and it just might be for you!</p>
                            <p>Unix has been around for ages, and still maintains a strong following in just about every sector. There are a ton of reasons why, and in this course, you will receive guidance from start to finish on an exploratory journey through Linux, a popular modern descendent of the original Unix. Get comfortable with the command line, text editors, scripting basics, and everything you need to shift your work environment into Linux! The best part is that you don't even have to give up your old operating system, as many Linux distributions can be booted from a USB flash drive.</p>
                            <p>This course is a bit daunting at first, and there are many things that come up that don't seem to make sense at first. I realized later that many of these things were a product of conditioning, and that unsurpassed flexibility is offered by the tools presented in this course. For me, it was well worth the move. I don't think I've booted into Windows in six months.</p>

                            <p>Learn how data is stored and organized in a typical SQL database. Creation, modification, and querying of databases provides a cursory understanding of how you can store and manipulate your own data for just about any purpose, from video games to managing a shipping company.</p>
                            <p>The skills gained in class can easily score you a job. A friend of mine recently graduated with a Math degree (CSCI concentration), and was actually told that if he had any SQL experience at all, he would've been a dead-ringer for the job. Once the foundation is laid, you can create your own personal databases for anything you can think of!</p>
                            <p>My favorite thing about this class was when I had to produce a user-interface for an investment firm database that I built. This was the first time that I made a deliberate decision to use multiple programming languages for a single task. I created a menu system for the user with Java, which output a Python script that applied SQL commands to the database. This was a lot of fun, and an indication that some of this education had been sticking after all.</p>
